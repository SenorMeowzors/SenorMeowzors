# Languages

## C#
I've been working on C# mostly in Unity projects. I have experience with both singleplayer and multiplayer games with [Mirror](https://github.com/MirrorNetworking/Mirror), which [ANEURISM IV](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2773280/ANEURISM_IV/) currently uses.

## Ruby
I've worked as a backend and frontend developer at [Amount](https://www.amount.com/) 

## C++
I've created a 3d game engine from scratch using GLFW

## Python
I've tutored students in Python, and helped them create several games using PyGame including a platformer, Pong, and Space Invaders
